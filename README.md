# Student Grades & Statistics in Python

This repository contains an educational Python project that demonstrates:

- **Basic statistics**: mean, variance, covariance for two data series
- **Matrix multiplication**: implementation of A × B product
- **List operations**: element-wise sum and product
- **Student grade analysis**:
  - Average grades per student and per subject
  - Identify top students
  - Filter students above a threshold
  - Calculate unique scores
  - Compute standard deviation per subject

## 📂 Project Structure

- `main.py` – Entry point, runs example calls for all parts
- `MerosA.py` – Basic statistics (mean, variance, covariance)
- `MerosB.py` – Matrix multiplication
- `MerosΓ.py` – List operations (sum & product)
- `MerosΔ.py` – Student grade analytics functions

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```bash
python main.py
